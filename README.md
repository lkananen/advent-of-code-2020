## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an "christmas calendar for programmers". The creator, [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), started an annual online event in the December of 2015. From then on each year, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day starting on Dec 1st midnight (EST/UTC-5). All developers and code enthusiasts of different skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose.

## Solutions
Details about solutions can be found in the subfolders and their README files.
